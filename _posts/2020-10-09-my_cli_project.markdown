Creating this project is the most uncomfortable I have been in a very long time. This project forced me to cope with not knowing whether or not I am on the correct path. Despite my lack of comfort, I had a lot of fun making it! 

For me, the first steps are always the hardest. I struggled for hours trying to find a suitable API that I would have fun working with. Naturally, I gravitated to APIs that centered on memes. Unfortunately, most meme APIs included pictures, which is not something I was capable of manipulating in a simple CLI project. The next best thing I found was a Pokémon API! I was so excited that I found it and was really happy that I could finally, oficially start my project. 

I was able to create a project that lists the original 151 Pokémon and prompts you to learn more about each of their abilities. While I am pretty happy with what I came up with, I would have loved more time to flesh it out and include things like Pokémon's stats, descriptions of their abilities, as well as the games in which they've been included. 

Overall, I am satisfied with I have created in the time that I had.
