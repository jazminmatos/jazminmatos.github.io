I have always wanted to learn about software engineering, but was always discouraged from pursuing it. I saw computer science as something only geniuses could do or something that you needed to have years of experience doing prior to undergrad. Additionally, due to media portrayal and lack of representation, I only ever saw white men in these fields. In fact, I remember wanting to sign up for Flatiron a few years ago, but was told by an older man that I would never be able to get a job in that field and would therefore never succeed.

Recently, I decided to finally dip my toe into the coding waters and take advantage of being at home more often due to quarantine by signing up for a short coding bootcamp. I learned CSS, HTML, and Javascript basics and absolutely loved it. It was 5-10 hours a week for 15 weeks. Due to its short timeline, I have found that it didn't give me as much information as I wanted to learn. And so, I began looking for a more comprehensive bootcamp where I could learn more. 

Why Flatiron? I first heard of this school from a friend that did the on-campus program and he had nothing but good things to say about it. When researching bootcamps, I decided to do the coding bootcamp prep and really enjoyed the format and found it very clear and easy to follow along. I also love the flexibility that Flatiron offers to learn remotely. 

I look forward to working closely with my peers and taking this 10 month long journey with them.
